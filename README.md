**Front-End Technology**

- React JS
- Firebase hosting
- Material UI
- Flexbox
- 3rd party Ticker
- Scroll snap

**Backend Technology**

- Node.js
- Express.js
- Mongodb
- Mongoose
- Hosting on Heroku

## Some important point about this project:

- Let me clear about the fact that what do you mean by mern stack. so here `M` stand for `mongoDB`, `E` stand for `Express`, `R` stand for `React JS` and `N` for `Node JS`.
- We will go in depth and make the tiktok-clone app using React.
- we will also be using `Firebase` for frontend hosting, `Mongo` for database and `Heroku` for backend hosting.
- `Firebase` is great tool to get started with project quickly. we will also using `HTML & CSS`.
- Please make sure, you need to have [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) and [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.

**Are you Pumped? Let's Gooooo üöÄ**

- To get started let's make a new folder name as `tiktok`. and inside make another two folder- `tiktok-frontend` and `tiktok-backend` respectively & open it.

- As soon as you are in the folder, right click and open with the code.

- After you click Open with code you'll see a huge weird window. Don't worry we got you covered. This is what you might be seeing.

- So, Visual Studio code is a code editor we are going to use. but you can use Atom or any other editor too, but it will make your life easier. üòè

- Now that you're in Visual studio code, press ctrl+ J (Windows) and you should see a terminal at the bottom just like shown below.

- Don't freak out, this is just a regular terminal, we're not hacking anything. :grinning:
